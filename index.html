            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Stretch the balloon holding it long ways.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: gently tug to avoid it breaking</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Take your balloon and bring the part with a hole over the nozzle of the pump. Hold this in place so it’s secure.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Inflate the balloon using a balloon pump.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: 1 Follow the instructions on your specific balloon pump as the designs may vary.
                    2 Inflate until there’s roughly two inches of deflated balloon on the opposite side as the hole.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Tie a knot on the end piece where the hole is of the balloon to keep the air in. Do this by stretching the end of the balloon as far as you can and wrap it around two fingers to give yourself enough space to to thread the end through. Pull it secure to tie the knot.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip:  If you’ve never done this before it may take a couple tries. Don’t give up!</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Starting on the tight end where the knot is, twist three small bubbles that are equal in size. The bubbles should be roughly the length of your palm.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: The bubbles should take up a bit less than half the size of the balloon length.</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Lock twist. Take the inner two bubbles and hold them parallel to each other and twist to secure them.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: After this step, you should start to see a head and snout</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Twist three more bubbles, all the same size, directly behind the head.</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Lock twist again this should create the legs and neck.</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Grab behind the legs and twist a slightly longer bubble. This will be it’s torso.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: The torso bubble should be the length of your entire hand.</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 10: </strong>After the torso bubble, using the remaining part of the inflated balloon, twist three small bubbles of equal size.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: The bubbles should be roughly the length of your palm.</p>
                <img src="#" alt="Image of...">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Step 11: </strong>Lock twist, as you did in Step 4 and 6, but on the other end of the balloon. This will create the hind legs and tail.</p>
                <p class="tip">Tip: Twist until the deflated tip of the balloon is facing upwards. This will create a tail shape.
                </p>
